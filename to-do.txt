To do:
    functions.php
        - fix navbar so it has a Study section instead of Book maybe?
            - maybe give it a dropdown so you can easily navigate between
                - Overview
                - Grammar Quiz
                - Vocabulary Quiz
            - or make it so that section changes depending on your state   
    
    book.php
        - should load 5 pages at a time I believe. 
            - less than 5 is too small. More than 5 might be overwhelming.
        - General aesthetics
            - needs some padding
                - look at the button on the bottom of the page
            - 
        - Kanji tab doesn't load any kanji.
            - what kind of kanji information do we want? do we even need this tab?
            - isn't the kanji the user learns basically just the reading of the words
            - with kanji, or the single 1 kanji words, which are few.
            - put kanji in the 
        - Grammar isn't actually how we want grammar yet
            - make the title of the box the title of the grammar point, and separate them into their own 
              grammar points.
            - each page or book should have a list of grammar.
            - that list should be pulled and listed here, so there are no repeats.
            - if it were on a per-sentence basis, then there would be a bajillion repeats.
                - unless we gathered all of the unique grammar tags and 
                - pulled explanations based on that.
        - 
    
    books.php
        - we might not need this (at least for users).
            - it might be useful for admins to see all the data in the system at a given time
        - not sure we need this page anymore
    
    vocabulary.php
        - there are no instructions for the user. 
            - how do they know how to interact with the flashcards?
            - the flashcards don't even look like flashcards
            - bad user experience
            - add in instructions
            - 
        
    
    grammar.php
    
    quiz.php
        - this should basically be a buffed up merger between vocabular.php and grammar.php
            - should it draw some of the same questions from the pre-learning quiz?
                - no I don't think so
            - but this implies that the questions in the DB need to be labeled as practice or test
                so that is a DB consideration. Another column, perhaps. 
            - should be fixed and designed on a per-text basis I believe.
    
    feedback.php    
        - this should be pretty standard, aside from potentially including the actual translations of texts
            (for asking if they understood it properly/ as well as they had thought)
          /self-evaluate, how well did you understand?
          
    
    
    activity.php
        - probably don't need this anymore or at all

    profile.php
        - probably don't need this anymore or at all
