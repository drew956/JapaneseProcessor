To do:
    functions.php
        - fix navbar so it has a Study section instead of Book maybe?
            - maybe give it a dropdown so you can easily navigate between
                - Overview
                - Grammar Quiz
                - Vocabulary Quiz
            - or make it so that section changes depending on your state   
    
    book.php
        - Kanji tab doesn't load any kanji.
            - what kind of kanji information do we want? do we even need this tab?
            - isn't the kanji the user learns basically just the reading of the words
            - with kanji, or the single 1 kanji words, which are few.
            - put kanji in the 
        - Grammar isn't actually how we want grammar yet
            - go back through and write grammar titles and then grammar explanations
            - make the code pull this information out and display it somewhat nicely
            - without this we cannot create the grammar quiz.
            - also create some examples
        - 
    
    books.php
        - we might not need this (at least for users).
            - it might be useful for admins to see all the data in the system at a given time
        - not sure we need this page anymore
    
    vocabulary.php
        - there are no instructions for the user. 
            - how do they know how to interact with the flashcards?
            - the flashcards don't even look like flashcards
            - bad user experience
            - add in instructions
            - 
        
    
    grammar.php
        - the questions should test their knowledge. 
            - thus they should be either fill in the blank, 
            - multiple choice involving grammar usage (conjugation, etc)
            - or choose the correct translation of the following blah blah
            - which means there will be multiple types of questions being pulled from the DB
                - how do we want to handle the answer-checking?
                - client side is bad practice, but would be easy to implement
                - server side is ideal, 
                    - we could have the id of the inputs be the type of input they are + their id in the DB
                    - thus the DB could easily look up the correct answer and know how to process the data
    
    quiz.php
        - this should basically be a buffed up merger between vocabular.php and grammar.php
            - should it draw some of the same questions from the pre-learning quiz?
                - no I don't think so
            - but this implies that the questions in the DB need to be labeled as practice or test
                so that is a DB consideration. Another column, perhaps. 
        - 
    
    feedback.php    
        - this should be pretty standard, aside from potentially including the actual translations of texts
            (for asking if they understood it properly/ as well as they had thought)
          /self-evaluate, how well did you understand?
          
    
    
    activity.php
        - probably don't need this anymore or at all

    profile.php
