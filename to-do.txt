To do:
    - fix navbar so it has a Study section instead of Book maybe?
        - maybe give it a dropdown so you can easily navigate between
            - Overview
            - Grammar Quiz
            - Vocabulary Quiz
        - or make it so that section changes depending on your state   
    - vocabulary.js 
        - right now when we try to reset the flashcard before moving to the right or left it
        - results in the reset happening AFTER we update the flashcard 
        - needs to be fixed. Maybe trigger reset without animating?
